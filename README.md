# Nine Men's Morris

## Overview
This application allows two players to enjoy the Nine Men's Morris on a virtual board. The game is played on a unique 24-position board with three nested squares, each having eight positions at the corners and midpoints. These squares are connected at the midpoints, creating an interconnected grid. Each player has 9 pieces, and they take turns placing and moving these pieces. The goal is to remove the opponent's pieces by forming mills â€” three of your pieces in a row.

## Gameplay Phases
1. Placement Phase:
   - Players take turns placing their pieces on empty positions on the board.
   - The goal is to form mills while strategically positioning pieces for the movement phase.
2. Movement Phase:
   - Once all pieces are placed, players take turns moving their pieces to adjacent connected positions.
   - Forming mills during this phase allows players to remove opponent pieces.
   - Players must pass their turn if no valid moves are available.
3. Final Phase
   - Once a player has only 3 pieces left, they can move them to any available position (not limited to adjacent positions).
   - If a player has fewer than 3 pieces, they lose the game.

## Additional Features
